The SIGCSE 2015 call for papers has been posted.

This year's theme is <b>{{site.data.main.theme}}</b>. Papers, posters, workshops, and special sessions exploring this theme---or, more broadly, the themes of computing education as it pertains to teaching and learning for young or old alike---are welcomed.


{% callout warning %}
We will announce when we are ready to begin accepting submissions. This will be mid-summer 2014, and the announcement will be made via the <a href="{{site.base}}/">SIGCSE 2015 blog</a>, Twitter, and the SIGCSE mailing list.
