The SIGCSE 2015 call for papers has been posted.

This year's theme is <b>{{site.data.main.theme}}</b>. Papers, posters, workshops, and special sessions exploring this theme---or, more broadly, the themes of computing education from youth through lifelong learner---are welcomed.

We'll announce (via the website, Twitter, and other mechanisms) as the deadline approaches and our submission system comes online.
