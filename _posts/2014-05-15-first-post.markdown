For some of us, the school year has ended, the grades are in, and we have approximately 290 days until SIGCSE 2015. For others, the school year is not over, and we're wishing it was. Actually, now that I think about it, for some of us, the school year is *just starting*, and you probably have very mixed feelings about that.

OK, so depending on which hemisphere you live in, your chosen occupation, and a host of other factors, the school year may, or may not, have started for you. If you're reading this, however, it is likely that you went to school at some point. Well, unless you were home schooled...

This is going nowhere.

The important thing is that we're roughly 290 days until SIGCSE 2015, and we have the start of a website. That's what matters. Bugs and whatnot should be sent to **jadud** at acm.org.
