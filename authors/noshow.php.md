SIGCSE Conference Presenter Substitution/No-Show Policy {.section}
-------------------------------------------------------

Submission of a paper, panel, special session, workshop, poster, working
group, birds-of-feather or anything else for presentation at a SIGCSE
conference (SIGCSE, ITiCSE, ICER) means that if the proposal is accepted
at least one of the authors will register for the conference and attend
the conference to "present" the proposal. If drastic unforeseen
circumstances prevent the presenting author from attending and
presenting, it is his/her responsibility to arrange a qualified
substitute presenter. If a substitution is necessary, the conference
program committee chairs should be notified as early as possible with
all pertinent details. At their discretion and dependent upon
circumstances, the program chairs may elect to inform upcoming SIGCSE
conference program chairs about the substitution (or the failure to
provide a substitute). This could jeopardize the acceptance of proposals
from those involved for the upcoming conferences. In extreme cases, the
SIGCSE Board may send a letter to the parent institution of a delinquent
author expressing displeasure. This policy was approved by the SIGCSE
Board in June of 2008.
