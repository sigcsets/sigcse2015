<p> Be the first to tweet the name of the orange-sweatered individual in this picture with the tags <b>#sigcse</b> <b>#prizetwo</b> to <b>@sigcsets</b>, and you'll win a special prize. For double-extra-bonus-prizeness, correctly guess <i>how many SIGCSE conferences that individual has attended</i>. The closest guess that is <i>equal to or less than</i> the number will be declared the winner. Ties will <strike>be resolved through a thumb-wrestling match</strike> all receive prizes.</p>
