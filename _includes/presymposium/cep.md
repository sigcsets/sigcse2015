The Cyber Education Project (CEP) is an initiative supported by a diverse group of computing professionals representing academic institutions and professional societies to develop undergraduate curriculum guidelines and a case for accreditation for a baccalaureate in “Cyber Science.” Organized in July 2014, CEP is currently leveraging a community of interest to inform and drive this work forward.
