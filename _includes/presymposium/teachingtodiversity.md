Computer science classrooms need to better incorporate a wide diversity of perspectives, to address the shortfall in the number of students pursuing CS degrees and subsequent careers.

This workshop will provide CS faculty the opportunity to discuss how culturally sensitive pedagogies can enhance underrepresented studentsâ€™ interest, success and retention in computer science. Following a discussion on what it means to teach to diversity, examples of culturally competent curriculum will be presented from TIDES institutions and other invited speakers. Workshop attendees will then be challenged to consider how to infuse culture into their own CS courses.

TIDES (Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM) is an AAC&U STEM Initiative and is generously funded by the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust.
