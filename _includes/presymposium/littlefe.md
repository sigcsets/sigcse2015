The LittleFe buildout event is a training and infrastructure opportunity for teams of faculty and students from educational institutions across the United States. Accepted participating teams receive a free LittleFe educational appliance (http://littlefe.net), which they assemble from a kit during the buildout and take home with them after the event. Together with its Bootable Cluster CD operating system (BCCD, http://bccd.net), LittleFe/BCCD is an ideal environment for learning and teaching parallel programming, cluster computing, and computational/data enabled science & engineering (CDESE). 

During the buildout, participants assemble their LittleFe unit from a kit, install the BCCD, learn about curriculum modules available on the platform, and commit to using the unit in their classes and developing new curriculum modules. The event is supported by the National Science Foundation (grant number 1347089); the Shodor Education Foundation, Inc.; the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE); and Earlham College.
