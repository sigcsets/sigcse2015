The role of the department chair is one of the most important, yet most difficult, in the academy.  Chairs must navigate the delicate balance that results when changing from a colleague or peer to supervisor.  SIGCSE is again sponsoring a special pre-conference workshop to offer some helpful training to new or prospective department chairs.  The session will be led by a group of veteran department chairs that will make presentations and lead discussions.  Administrative issues addressed will include: (1) creating a workplace that fosters excellence, cooperation, and new ideas; (2) managing problem students, faculty, and staff; (3) setting goals and measuring success; and (4) developing good relationships with deans and other upper-level administrators.  Additional topics on leadership characteristics, management styles, time management, legal issues, establishing priorities, and communication will focus on best practices that produce efficient and effective chairs. 

Resource materials will be provided to participants.  In addition to receiving valuable chair training, participants are expected to establish a new network of associates, mentors, and advisors.  If you are a new chair, a veteran chair, or are considering a chair position, please plan to participate in the SIGCSE 2015 Roundtable for Department Chairs.  Send questions and/or expressions of interest to Sandra J. DeLoatch (<a href="mail:sjdeloatch@nsu.edu">sjdeloatch@nsu.edu</a>).
