Demos provide a way to showcase an educational tool or project in a live setting.  Not designed to be sales pitches, demonstrations are a way for the community to see the relevance, potential and innovation of the tool and allow time for discussion with its creator. Proposals will be anonymously reviewed for acceptance, much like papers, and <b>must</b> specify any power, A/V equipment, space, or other needs.  Demos will will occur during break periods at a designated space in the exhibition hall.
