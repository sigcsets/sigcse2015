Demos provide a way to showcase an educational tool or project in a live setting.  Not designed to be sales pitches, demonstrations are a way for the community to see the relevance, potential and innovation of the tool and allow time for discussion with its creator. Proposals (including abstract) are limited to two pages and will be anonymously reviewed for acceptance. Proposals must specify any equipment needs (e.g., power, A/V equipment, space needs).  Demos will be 30 minutes in length and will occur during break periods at a designated space in the exhibition hall.
