 Birds of a Feather (BOF) sessions provide an environment for colleagues
with similar interests to meet for informal discussions. A maximum
one-page description (including abstract) is requested to describe the
informal discussion topic. A/V equipment will not be provided for these
sessions. Approximately 45 minutes are allocated to each BOF topic.
