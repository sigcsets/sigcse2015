Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience,
teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool. Two
versions of a submission are required: a full version having author
names and affiliations and an anonymous version for use in reviewing.
Papers will undergo a blind reviewing process and must not exceed six
pages. Authors will have approximately 25 minutes for their
presentations, including questions and answers.
