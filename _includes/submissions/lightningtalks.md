Lightning talks describe works in progress, new and untested ideas, or opportunities for collaborative work.  The purpose of a lightning talk can be to start a discussion, find collaborators, or receive input and critique about an idea.  Proposals are limited to 500 words and will be anonymously reviewed for acceptance.  Lightning talk presentations will be 5 minutes each and given without media/slide support.
