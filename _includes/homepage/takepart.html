				Reviewers

			<p>
        SIGCSE is an excellent conference because of the hard work of its community. Every submission—be it paper, poster, or otherwise—is reviewed by people just like you. 
			</p>
      <p>
        This year, we have two new categories (Lightning Talks and Demos), and we need your help reviewing more than ever.

				Hey Students!
			</h2>
      <p>
        There are two ways you should consider getting involved at SIGCSE!
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: -40px;">
        <li><b>The ACM Student Research Competition</b> is open to undergraduate and graduate students alike, and is a great venue for getting involved and gaining experience presenting your work.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Students help make SIGCSE happen</strong>. Student volunteers have a long and noble tradition at SIGCSE—your webmaster got his start there, after all! Volunteering helps make things run the way they should, and saves you registration fees.</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="{{site.base}}/students/">Find out more about both of these great opportunities.</a>
