## Registering for SIGCSE {{site.data.main.year}}

{{site.data.main.upper}} {{site.data.main.year}} takes place between {{site.data.main.month}} {{site.data.main.start}} and {{site.data.main.month}} {{site.data.main.end}} this year.

As always, we encourage attendees to register early; this helps us with our planning, and in return, you get lower registration rates! And, of course, you can <a href="http://www.sigcse.org/membership/join">join ACM SIGCSE</a>, which will further reduce your rates. Joining SIGCSE is $45 for professionals and $8 for students, so it really is to your benefit to join the world's premier professional computer science education organization!

## Reserving a Room at the {{site.data.main.conferenceHotel}}

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
<p>Our conference hotel is the <b>{{site.data.main.conferenceHotel}}</b>. The rumor on the street in KC is that <i>{{site.data.main.upper}} booked the whole thing</i>. So, take that conference rate, and book rooms for yourself and all of your colleaguesâ€”this would be great year to bring the whole department/division/school.
</p>

<p>**We're excited to note that our conference hotel and venue hotel are one and the same!** Sessions and accommodations are all under the same roof.</p>

<p>So <a href="{{site.data.main.bookingURL}}">go reserve your room now</a>. You might as well: it's the 2014-2015 budget year, and at least this way you won't be thinking about it all through the fall term.</p>

## Getting to SIGCSE {{site.data.main.year}}

### {{site.data.main.nearestAirport}} (Airport Code: {{site.data.main.nearestAirportCode}})

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">    
<p>    
  Our airport is {{site.data.main.nearestAirport}} (<a href="http://www.flykci.com/">http://www.flykci.com/</a>). 
</p>
<p>
  The airport's phone number is <b>+1-(816)-243-5237</b>. 
</p>
<p>
  Once you get to the airport, you'll probably want to leave. There are <a href="http://www.flykci.com/Direction/GroundTransportation/Index.htm">many ground transport services that you might investigate</a>. Having spent some time digging around the <a href="http://www.kcata.org/">KCATA website</a> (Kansas City's public transit service), it looks like the <a href="http://www.kcata.org/maps_schedules/routes/129_boardwalk_kci">129 bus service stops at all terminals and provides transit downtown</a>. This is a $1.50 fare (exact change). According to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Kansas+City+International+Airport,+601+Brasilia+Ave,+Kansas+City,+MO+64153/Kansas+City+Marriott+Downtown,+200+W+12th+St,+Kansas+City,+MO+64105/@39.2268637,-94.6533486,11z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m16!4m15!1m5!1m1!1s0x87c05e0888e68799:0xc3cdd0195d2edaa0!2m2!1d-94.712594!2d39.300643!1m5!1m1!1s0x87c0f05c3a99cf1b:0x9ccdfaf81d70a39b!2m2!1d-94.586282!2d39.100269!2m1!6e4!3e3">Google's public transit directions</a>, this trip looks to take just over an hour, and you will be dropped off at 10th and Broadway. This is roughly a 5 minute walk from the KC Marriott Downtown. 
</p>
<p>
  Please note, the directions regarding bus usage have not been validated or verified by anyone who 1) lives in KC or 2) has ever attempted the journey described.

</p>
<p>
  If you decide you want to do public transport, make sure that your arrival time allows for this. For example, the last bus out from the airport seems to be around 11PM; have a backup plan if you think your flight might be delayed and prevent you from catching your bus.
</p>
<p>
   SIGCSE has a <a href="http://groups.supershuttle.com/sigcse.html">SuperShuttle discount code</a> if you want to do that. You can also take a cab or rent a car; those both tend to work the same in most every country I've visited; remember, always tip your cabbie.
