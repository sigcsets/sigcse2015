## Conference Hotel

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
<p>Our conference hotel is the <b>{{site.data.main.conferenceHotel}}</b>. The rumor on the street in KC is that <i>{{site.data.main.upper}} booked the whole thing</i>. So, take that conference rate, and book rooms for yourself and all of your colleagues—this would be great year to bring the whole department/division/school.
</p>

<p>As you can see, the hotel is conveniently located near other buildings, some of which are shiny.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="{{site.data.main.bookingURL}}">go reserve your room now</a>. You might as well: it's the 2014-2015 budget year, and at least this way you won't be thinking about it all through the fall term.</p>

## Transport To/From the Airport

If you're coming from the airport, you may want to <a href="http://groups.supershuttle.com/sigcse.html">take advantage of the SuperShuttle discount code that we have</a>. You can also take a cab, rent a car, walk, or use any other mode of locomotion that appeals to you.

## Awesome Stuff To Do in KC

The <a href="http://www.visitkc.com/index.aspx">Kansas City Visitor's Bureau</a> has a great deal to say about the city. We have a few favorites as well, and will discuss them in the blog over the coming months.  

When selecting the city, Adrienne and Kurt found a few things they thought were huge fun. For example, when selecting KC, Adrienne broke this sign, vandal that she is.

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="{{site.base}}/images/kc/KC15.jpg" alt="Adrienne leaning on a street sign." />
</div>

<br/>

Which, as it happens, is why Kurt had to take a sabbatical this year; he's still holding that sign up. Honest.

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="{{site.base}}/images/kc/KC18.jpg" alt="Kurt leaning on a street sign." />
</div>

<br/>

We don't encourage vandalism, as it goes against the ACM professional code of conduct. Sadly, there is little to be done about your SIGCSE Conference Chairs. They're a rough bunch.
